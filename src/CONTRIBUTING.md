# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Please follow these steps:

## Development setup
- See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md)
- Use feature branches and small, focused pull requests.

## Commit style
- Conventional commits are appreciated (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, chore:)

## Pull requests
- Include a clear description and screenshots/GIFs when relevant.
- Add/update docs and tests for user-facing changes.

## Issues
- Use the templates and provide reproduction steps, versions, and screenshots.

## Code style
- Keep changes minimal and avoid reformatting unrelated code.
- Prefer transactions for cross-doc consistency and always deep-clean Firestore writes.
