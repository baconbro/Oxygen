## Firebase Configuration
To configure Firebase for your project, follow these steps:

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project.

Add your Firebase configuration to the .env file. You can find these values in your Firebase project settings. The .env file should look like this:

```bash
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```
Save the .env file.


## Motivation 

Oxygen started as a personal quest for a simpler, more powerful project management system. Frustrated with the bloat and cost of existing solutions like Jira, I set out to create something truly open and efficient.  While it's a solo endeavor for now, my hope is that Oxygen will resonate with others who share this vision.

Why Oxygen?

Escape the expensive trap: Tired of expensive licenses and complex setups? Oxygen offers a free and open alternative.
Built for Speed: Oxygen is designed for a streamlined workflow, helping you focus on what matters most.
Your Vision, Your Way: Customize and adapt Oxygen to perfectly match your unique needs and preferences.
Transparency is Key: With Oxygen's open-source, you have complete control and visibility.

Oxygen embraces the open-source philosophy:

Reduced Costs: Eliminate licensing fees and redirect resources towards customization and innovation.
Improved Quality: Harness the collective intelligence of a global community to identify and resolve bugs faster.
Rapid Development: Embrace agile methodologies and accelerate your development cycles.
Future-Proof Solutions: Open source fosters continuous improvement and adaptability, ensuring your software remains relevant.
Community Support: Tap into a vast network of experts and enthusiasts ready to help you succeed.

While Oxygen is currently a one-person show, your support can make a big difference.  Even if you're not a developer, you can contribute by:

Testing Oxygen and providing feedback.
Spreading the word about the project.
Sharing your ideas and feature requests.
Oxygen may be a solo project for now, but with your help, it can become something truly special. Let's build a better ticketing system together!


## Not agile ?

Oxygen uses and make the most of agile methodologie, but you do not have to be an expert to use it. You don't even have to know anything about agile to start managing your projects.


### Support üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

- For now it's community support only.


## Collaboration

I really hope to motivate other to join me to build the best sets of tool ever build to help everyone, and every organisation to acheive more. 
Do not hesitate to be in touch.
